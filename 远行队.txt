'''远行队'''由一到多名殖民者组成，建立后可达成多种目标。在按计划进行贸易时，动物、殖民者和囚犯都可以携带货物;创建远行队的目的也可以是进攻其它团体。每个远行队都会在[[Menus#World|世界地图]]上以黄色图标显示。双击远行队图标将会显示屏幕上的所有远行队，此时你可以命令他们移动到同一个地区。

与其等待其它部落的商队来找你，不如组建你自己的远行队来维持贸易线路。友好派系的定居点中有更多的货物可供贸易，价格也比商队优惠2%。商队的贸易品受限于它的运载量。这种贸易也比通讯台贸易更实惠。

== 创建远行队 ==

在世界地图上，选中殖民地图标并点击<tt>'组建远行队'</tt>。 此时弹出一个对话框用于选择殖民者、动物和物品。可以创建多个远行队。

: <p>'''''注意:''''' 在没有殖民者的定居点上点击 <tt>'遗弃'</tt> 按键后，会直接将其设为无法进入的废墟并永远消失，在此期间没有任何确认按键。</p>

=== 人与动物 ===
选择将要加入队伍的殖民者、搬运待售物品的动物(例如[[羊驼]]、[[骆驼]]、[[雪牛]])、需要运输的囚犯。至少需要选择一名囚犯。确保选择的殖民者身体健康，因为受伤或者生病的殖民者会拖慢远行队速度。

组建远行队的过程主要可以分为三种:
* 不需要使用驮运动物的远行队组建最快。殖民者只需要携带好物品就可以快速离开。
* 需要使用驮运动物的远行队必须先转载驮运动物，这需要花费一些时间。如果要装载的东西很多而搬运工很少，那这个时间会很漫长。
* 正处于旅行状态的远行队可以立刻重组，不需要装载过程。

远行队创建过程中，无法选择无行为能力的殖民者。但远行队旅行过程中，可以将这种人带到队伍中。注意，无行为能力者会严重拖慢远行队速度。

远行队会以队伍中最好的谈判者命名。

=== 物品 ===

在「物品」选项卡中选择远行货物。在打包物品时，只能选择位于居住区或存储区的物品。但在重组远行队时，可以选择整个地图中的物品。

携带能力:

* 殖民者/囚犯：35千克。这个大小包括了服装、工具和已经携带的物品。
* 雪牛: 73.5 千克
* 单峰骆驼: 70 千克
* 羊驼: 35 千克
* 象: 140 千克

没有成年的动物携带能力更弱。

如果殖民者或动物已经携带了某些物品(例如穿着的衣物)，他们的携带能力会自动扣除这些东西的重量。

累计可携带容量和已选物品质量列在顶端。可以使用按键来切换物品/总重。 双箭头[>>]会选择物品的最大数量。箭头[>M]表示你不能拿完全部物品，但是会自动帮你选中可以携带的最大数量。当携带重量过多时，[M<]会退回部分或全部此物品，以尽量保证总质量不超过远行队可携带重量。

可以使用如下快捷键快速修改[>]所调整数量:<br/>
{{Key|CTRL}}: +10 <br/>{{Key|SHIFT}}: +100 <br/>{{Key|CTRL}}+{{Key|SHIFT}}: +1000. <br/>该快捷方式同样适用于[<] 箭头。

如果远行队成员死时，处于可视画面，他们的物品会掉落。当然，这些物品可以被捡起来。如果死于世界地图（由于失血等原因），他们的携带物会丢失。如果所有的成员都死了，整个远行队都会消失，所有的物品都会丢失。

==== 食物 ====

只要条件允许，远行队在旅行期间会按需进食。旅途中，远行队中的殖民者会自动采集食物，采集速度由环境和殖民者种植技能决定。

旅途中一定要带够充足的食物。如果使用动物进行驮运，远行队的速度很可能会变慢，这就需要更多的食物。

未冷藏的食物很容易腐坏，需要仔细挑选:

* [[简单的食物]]适用于短途旅行 (<2.4 天).
* [[莓果]]适用于中等长度旅行, 但是重量略高 (<7 天).
* [[干肉饼]]适用于长途旅行 (少于75 天).
* [[包装生存食品]]超长期旅行必备食品 (>75 天).

自动优先消耗最易腐坏的食品。

旅途中，可能会触发世界地图事件，如猎杀人类、袭击、偶遇商队等，这些都会生成小地图。当威胁被消除后，有可能在地图关闭前缴获一些食物和草药。也许你的一些东西会散落在小地图上，记得把它们捡起来或在远行队重组界面选中，否则这些东西就再也找不到了。

=== 组建过程 ===

一旦下达组建远行队的命令，殖民者会聚集在[[远行队打包点]]或居住区内任意地点，然后等到所有殖民者集合。殖民者会见动物带到集合点，此后动物会在殖民者打包时围绕在他们周围。

推荐将远行队打包点放到仓库区内以减少打包时间。

After assembly, they will gather any needed supplies, putting them on pack animals if available. When they finish, they will head out to the map edges and wait for the other members to arrive, then exit the colony map and enter the world map.

Haulers not part of the caravan will also help in gathering the supplies.

Colonists will ignore any needs during the formation, except food (once they're starving they'll take a break to eat if food is available). Should they feel exhausted during the process, they won't rest in their bedrooms but collapse near the caravan packing spot.

They will also override the 'Forbid' command, taking forbidden items. If there is less of an item than ordered (e.g. meals which other colonists ate during the process), members will take what they can and then carry on without stopping.

A pawn can be temporarily interrupted by manually assigning them to do another task. They will resume caravan loading once the task is complete.

Any mental break of its members will pause the process until that member recovers. Downing or killing that member will interrupt the process, causing it to be cancelled.

[[File:The caravan formation process will continue when everyone recovers from a mental break.png|500px|thumb|none|Ufff...]]

If the formation was successful, the character roster on top of the screen will split, showing those who stayed at home and those who left with the caravan by greying them on a different "box".

[[File:Colonist roster of those at home and at caravan.png|500px]]

=== Caravan route & pathing ===

The 'Choose Route' button allows you to decide destinations for your colonists' caravan. Once a path is chosen, colonists will choose an exit direction that can best reduce travel time.

Once items have been loaded, party members will proceed separate ways according to their own classifications made by the player.

</gallery>

=== Tricks ===

* The act of gathering supplies allows a colonist to carry huge stacks of lightweight materials like cloth or food. This can be exploited to perform ''Super Hauling'' by having a colonist pick up all the goods on the map, drafting them into the storage room, and cancelling the caravan to unload. They will have hauled a massive number of supplies in one trip.

== Travelling ==
Once your caravan enters the world map, you can give it orders.

A caravan can:
* Move - Right-click to select destination. A line indicates the optimal route (accounting for terrain speed and elevation changes).
* Settle - Click Settle to create a new colony.
** You may not settle a new colony when already at maximum. The default maximum is one. This can increased to up to five in Menu - Options. 
** Settling directly adjacent to your own colony or any other settlement is not allowed.
* Enter back into the colony - Right-click the colony.
* Split - Click the Split button. Each caravan must consist of at least one colonist.
* Merge - Select two or more 远行队 in the same tile (by dragging a square zone) and click Merge to form a single caravan.
* Trade - When a caravan has reached a friendly faction outpost, click the trade button to open the trade dialog window. 
* Attack - A caravan can attack any faction outpost, regardless of relations status, though attacking will worsen relations.
* Offer gifts - If your relations with a faction are not high enough to trade, you can offer them gifts in an attempt to improve relations.

[[File:Caravan optimal route.png|300px]]

=== Status box ===

Several items are displayed in the status box.

#Movement status:
#* Traveling - moving to destination.
#* Resting - caravan automatically stops between hours 22 and 6 to sleep.
#* Waiting - no destination selected.
#* Stopped - stopped moving with reason given.
#Estimated time to destination - time to destination based on the current tile movement time.
#Days of food - compare this to 'estimated time to destination' to determine if your caravan has enough food for the journey.
#Base movement time: Movement speed based on the average speed of all the pawns in the caravan.
#Current tile movement time: Current movement speed based on the terrain, biome, weather (only affected during autumn-winter) or roads. (See table on this page for details.)
#Stealthiness: How stealthy your caravan is. Stealthier 远行队 are less prone to being ambushed.

A caravan may stop for various reasons, such as when;
*Between hours 22 and 6 while the members sleep and rest.
**They still continue to rest even if all members are fully rested.
**Colonists who had been assigned to the night shift in the Restrict tab will still follow this schedule.
*All colonists are downed or having a minor/major mental break.
*Any member is having an extreme mental break.
**Nobody will be harmed even if the colonist is going berserk.
**Minor or major mental breaks won't stop the caravan as long as at least one person is still functional. If a colonist is in the midst of a mental break when you settle or get ambushed, they will still be having it when they appear on the map.
*The player manually pauses the caravan.
**While paused 远行队 forage faster, members can socialize and the caravan is less likely to be attacked.

=== Sustenance ===
Pawns traveling in a caravan will eat automatically when necessary. Grazing animals, when hungry in a place with grazable plants, will instantly have their hunger bar refilled without any cost. If not, they will proceed to eat food carried in the caravan. Pawns will prioritize food that spoils earlier.

If a colonist has an injury or disease that requires tending, doctors will tend to them as necessary, using medicine if available to them. If self-tend is on they will also tend to themselves.

If you bring [[Beer]] along with you, colonists may drink it during their journey. The mood bonus it provides can help keep them sane when away from the colony for long stretches of time. (They don't appear to consume other recreational foods, such as chocolate or insect jelly. Testing is needed.)

==== Foraging ====

From Beta 19 onwards, every colonist in a caravan can forage for food.

Each colonist can forage 0.09 nutrition per day per level of Growing at a baseline, i.e. in temperate forests or swamps. Given that each colonist consumes 1.6 nutrition per day, this means that a level 9 Growing colonist can break even with food consumption when the caravan is resting, and a level 18 colonist can constantly forage more than he eats.

Foraging is affected by manipulation (50% importance, 100% max) or sight (90% importance), so giving caravanners [[bionic eye]]s or [[archotech eye]]s can help increase forage and hence let your food stocks last longer.

In addition, having a tribal start grants an extra 170% multiplier to foraging, as shown by a "Faction Type: 170%" line in the tooltip. If Tribal colonists with good Growing skills have enough meals or other food to eat during a trip through terrain with good forage, they may return with a nontrivial quantity of berries.

=== Movement Speed ===

Many things can affect the traveling speed of 远行队. Clothing, armor, traits, and health conditions all affect a pawn's movement speed. A caravan's movement speed is determined by the average speed of all of the members of the caravan across colonists and animals, followed by the total mass the caravan is carrying. Incapacitated pawns will greatly slow movement.

If inventory mass exceeds carrying capacity the caravan will become immobilized until the mass is reduced, such as by eating food, discarding goods or having another caravan join up to bring capacity above inventory mass.

Some examples of things that may slow you down:

* Clothing and armor (varies; [[flak vest]], [[flak jacket]], [[flak pants]], [[plate armor]] and [[marine armor]] have high movement penalties)
* Injured or downed colonists and prisoners
** Downed pawns can significantly slow down 远行队, much more than injured ones that are capable of walking.
* Traits (e.g. Slowpoke)
* Slower animals, including muffalo, dromedaries or alpacas (the animals that can haul goods in 远行队)
** Animals can be injured too. A muffalo missing a leg or two will slow down your caravan even more.
** Middle-stage pregnant animals move at 85% speed.
** Late-stage pregnant animals move at 70% speed.
** Juvenile animals move at 90% speed.
** Baby animals move at 50% speed.

Some things that can speed you up:
*Colonists equipped with [[Bionic leg]]s or high on [[go-juice]] or [[yayo]].
*Roads halve the time it takes to travel through a tile.
*远行队 carrying lighter items will move faster.

While the slower Muffalo and Dromedary speeds compared to the human base speed won't significantly affect shorter distances, baby animals and seriously injured colonists can have a significant impact, increasing travel time by 30% or more.

'''Note: this chart is outdated as of 1.0.'''

The following table lists the base caravan movement speed in hours per tile for an unencumbered human. Flat terrain is naturally easiest to travel. Hills and mountains will worsen travel speed, while roads speed it up. Biomes with cold winters have reduced movement speed during the winter. It appears to be interpolated based on the current season and temperature with the worst case values listed in the table below.

Note that it is unlikely that your caravan will travel at the speed listed here.

=== Tabs ===
The inspection pane has tabs to manage the caravan and view details.

In the 'Gear' tab, by clicking the red X you can drop items and lose them forever. Dropping items may be necessary if the caravan becomes overburdened and unable to move. 

You can also abandon colonists and prisoners in the 'Social' tab. Items carried by a dismissed pawn will be lost. Abandoning a caravan member will cause their friends and family to have sad thoughts, and if the colonist is unlikely to survive (such as low temperatures) there will be a more severe penalty. Colonists who survive may eventually make their way back to your colony, or return as part of an enemy raid or friendly caravan.

In the 'Gear' tab you can swap gear by dragging and dropping gear onto different colonists, or to and from the caravan inventory.

</gallery>

Once you arrive to the destination, just click the Trade icon to start negotiations.
[[File:Trade icon.png]]

=== Route planner ===
[[File:Caravan_planner.png|600px|thumb|rifht|Caravan planner having planned a route based a caravan's speed.]]

There is a route planner that allows you to roughly check the amount of time it takes to reach a destination, allowing you to plan ahead.

When it is opened, you can drop various waypoints around the world map. The game will calculate the time it takes for a 1 tile/h caravan to travel through the planned route. You can also place the starting point on an existing caravan to determine the time taken for a journey based on that caravan's speed.

{{clear}}

=== Returning home ===

After you arrive back to your colony, you will notice two details must be addressed before continuing the game.

* Pack animals may go straight to their animal bed or just wander around still with all your items inside their packing gear. If you happen to need something at the moment, you will have to make them drop it. You may want to restrict them to a roofed zone and wait for them to go there before doing this, so the dropped belongings won't deteriorate due to exposure, or you can wait until night when they are sleeping inside a room. Pack animals who have been trained for Obedience can be assigned to follow their master, who can be drafted to storage areas and wait until the animals follow him/her too to drop the items as well.
* Prisoners will still be carrying your caravan items too, even armor and weaponry (as odd as it may be). They will not unload their inventory after returning to base unless directed to through the gear tab, and will start to unload only after being recruited.

File:Prisoners keep your caravan items too.png|'''Prisoners keep your caravan items'''
File:Caravan prisoner unloading inventory.png|'''Prisoner unloading inventory after recruitment'''
</gallery>

=== Long distance journeys ===

Many basic technology options prove to be very helpful for long distance travel. Make frequent use of [[Campfire]]s, [[Pemmican]], [[Passive cooler]]s and [[Crafting spot]]s to resupply your 远行队 and keep healthy on the road, instead of one large ride. Take advantage by building settlements whenever you run low on food or resources. Generated maps can have forageable food and animals to hunt or even tame into the convoy. Colonists will also need time off to relax and restore their joy.

=== Multiple colonies and pitstops ===

The game options let you choose how many colonies (up to 5) you can have active on the globe at once. Temporary maps from events do not count towards this limit. In order to build beyond the game menu limits you must abandon an existing colony. 

Should you choose to make multiple settlements, it is not necessary to carry all your raw materials all the way from home base to a new spot. Lighten the load by carrying valuables such as silver, gold, [[drugs]] and then trading them with your new neighbors, or if you settled close enough, use [[transport pod]]s to launch everything over.

While travelling long distances consider bringing valuable items, then bartering for necessary supplies instead of bringing them.

If you know certain resources will be scarce in your new map's biome, or if you want to save time mining, some resources can be [[Advanced_Endgame_Guide#Resource_compression|compressed]] -- that is, built into items with a lower mass than their raw materials.

== Events ==

Caravan events take place on the road, which means that neither side will be engaging with the benefit of a base. The action takes place in the open and the player must take advantage on terrain features to defend themselves. Those who survive will have a 24 hours window to perform vital needs such as doctoring, resting and feeding as well as re-packing. [[:File:Pirate fed to animal.png|Eliminated hostiles can be fed to your animals]].

There are two different ways of re-packing: manually giving cargo animals the selected item to be carried or re-forming the caravan. The first alternative lets you make the most out of the area which may include mining, harvesting and cooking, while the last option will instantly leave the place. Either way, before the countdown timer ends, all items must be put to be carried or they will be '''lost''' once the time runs out.

=== Ambush ===
Your caravan has been ambushed by an enemy faction. Colonists cannot exit the map until the attackers are defeated (killed, downed, or fled). If all are killed, the caravan is considered destroyed and will disappear along with any carried items.

</gallery>

# The game notifies you that an ambush is taking place, prompting you to check on your caravan.
# Pause the game to survey the enemy, and position yourself by taking cover behind terrain features.
# Check where it's happening. As it is, in this case, right next to the colony, it's possible to quickly send reinforcements. However, you cannot send the back-up caravan right into the battle, but must first move to an adjacent tile before joining your comrades.
# After an encounter ends, a 24-hour countdown begins so you can recover, pick up items, strip the dead/downed and take care of any other need.
# To take prisoners, you should build the smallest room possible (remember you are on a countdown) which can just fit the same amount of sleeping spots for each downed enemy. Treat their wounds so they don't die while carrying them to your colony. Finally, reforming the caravan makes captives come with you (you will see them listed).
# Your prisoners are finally brought to your colony, but you see them wandering around (!!!). Don't worry as they won't attempt to escape. Your characters will proceed to unload their items. Eventually, wardens will come to pick them up and escort them to designated prison cells. Any incapacitated prisoners will remain downed and need to be carried.

==== Manhunter Ambush ====

Same as Ambush except with a manhunter pack. Manhunters won't attempt to flee, and colonists can't, either.

=== Demand ===

Pirates approach your caravan and demand that you give them items and hand over members as slaves. If you don't they will proceed to assault the caravan.

You can see the number of pirates when they are demanding you hand over items, as well as the items they are demanding.

It's nearly always a better choice to fight back as pirates usually come in poor numbers.

=== Encounter ===

Another friendly caravan crosses path with you, opening an opportunity to trade. 

You can attack them if you wish, damaging relations. Your pawns may exit the map while engaging the caravan. Since you will be informed of their party composition but cannot clearly see who is in the caravan, you can decide if they're worth robbing.

Sometimes when attacking them, they may decide to do a 'bloody exit', that is to exit as aggressively as possible.

[[File:Caravan met peacefully.png|400px]]

== Attacking other settlements ==

You may raid other settlements on the world map, much like other factions do to your colony. To do this, all you need is to send a caravan to a site, and select the "Attack" interaction option. Attacking settlements gives you an opportunity to steal valuable goods such as [[glitterworld medicine]], [[luciferium]], [[component]]s, as well as weapons and armor.

'''The below shows bases from Alpha 16. Settlement defenders of later updates are significantly strengthened and are harder to defeat, and are not scaled by difficulty as other raids are.'''
