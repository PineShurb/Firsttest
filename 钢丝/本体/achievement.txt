{{Version|1.10}}
Hearts of Iron IV has 132 different '''achievements''', all using the Steam achievements mechanics. Achievements have no in-game effects; the achievement just pops up in-game, and is then added to the player's Steam or Xbox profile depending on the version of the game. It is possible to see the achievements sorted by the percentage of users that managed to complete each achievement by going to the game's [http://steamcommunity.com/stats/394360/achievements/?l=english global achievements at Steam].

The difficulty of each achievement varies; some achievements are very easy (e.g. joining a faction), while some are more difficult (e.g. conquering {{flag|Australia}} as {{flag|Czechoslovakia}} or reaching 1948 as {{flag|France}} without ever surrendering). The below list groups the various achievements by a difficulty level as assessed by the wiki editors (uncategorized - UC - achievements haven't been assessed yet).

Achievements can only be gained in single-player [[Ironman]] games, with the 1936 start, on ''regular'', ''veteran'' or ''elite'' difficulty. (30 Minutes of Hel and Don’t Die for Your Country can only be completed in the 1939 start date.) They can be earned while playing older versions of the game as long as said achievements were present in that version. They can also be earned with ''Historical AI Focuses'' set to off. {Note:There is no "end date", the game can be continued indefinitely}

It is not possible to gain achievements if the [[checksum]] has been changed - either by tampering with game files, or by running the game using mods that affect gameplay mechanics (graphical mods do not affect checksum), or a corrupted installation.

== List of achievements ==
<!-- It is fine to re-order these achievements based on perceived difficulty as long as a justification is included in the edit summary. -->
The "Notes" column lists helpful short tips/strategies.

The {{icon|hoi4|width=21px}} column denotes achievements which can't be completed without the use of DLC mechanics (currently 45 out of 132). Multiple expansion icons mean either can be used.

The "Ver" column indicates in which version a certain achievement was added. Achievements cannot be earned prior to the version they were added in.

The "DI" column is for difficulty as assessed by wiki editors. VE = Very Easy, E = Easy, M = Medium, H = Hard, VH = Very Hard, I = Insane, UC = Uncategorized.

| You don't need DLC for this. Just go democratic and wait for world tension to rise. Recommend speed 5, you don't need technologies or focuses. You don't need to rush democracy because world tension will be under 80% for a long time. If the La Résistance DLC is active, you can just rush the focus [[Portuguese_national_focus_tree#Join_the_Allies|''"Join the Allies"'']] as well as some of the other focuses that increase the UK's opinion of you instead of waiting for world tension to rise.

To trigger the civil war do not arrest the king and go down the focus "The Right to Rule". Before the civil war fires delete all land units and make a single calvary division in training. Deploy it in Athens after the war starts and take all victory points to quickly end the civil war.

If you don't have BoTB, you can just do the normal civil war trick. Delete all of your army and do the "Political Effort" focus, use your PP to hire a communist revolutionary for 0.10+ daily communism support. Then, don't do any focuses. Use your PP to Expand Civil support, but have a cavalry division ready to deploy. When you achieve less than 50% stability, ignite civil war and deploy the cavalry division. Rush for the victory points to the win!

| As any country, preferably recommended to select neutral nations ({{icon|neutrality}}), as to avoid the “Strategic reasons” diplomatic penalty ({{red|–100|back}} value), that may block the “Request License Production” option, improve relations with five of the seven major powers then license the basic infantry weapons. (Researching the next level of infantry equipment also works, as even major nations have few problems with licensing outdated equipment.)

Yugoslavia can pick the focuses "Reinforce Old Alliances" and "Ban Slovene Nationalist Parties" to improve relations with three of the five countries. 

Easy as China, they start with fairly good relations with all the majors, except Japan.

Alternatively you can also play a longer and larger game and just simply either ally or puppet all of the major nations and then get licenses from them.

With La Resistance DLC you can use an agent and assing him diplomatic pressure on majors, it will make getting the achievement even easier

The Bulgarian focus "The Fate of the Balkans" allows for the peaceful puppeting of Turkey.  The Greek focuses resulting from "Resurrecting the Megali Idea" allow for a war with Turkey where you will gain Istanbul. Simply invite the UK, France, and Italy then promise them all concessions. Some of them will join the war and grant you the needed land. It is also possible to combine this achievement with "Balkan Problem Solved" and request the required land from Turkey peacefully by a decision in exchange of 75 PP. An other option is to follow the communist branch of Bulgaria and at the very end complete the focus 'The Unification of the Balkans'. This focus unlocks a decision to ask Turkey for control of the states needed for this achievement. Currently, if Turkey refuses, the decision will appear again after a few days. So once you have 75 PP you can try again until Turkey does accept. This is a bug, seeing as its unlikely that it was intended for that decision to have more then one use.

With historical focuses on, {{Flag|Yugoslavia}} will have Peter II take the throne with the Underage Monarch trait. The Bulgarian focus "Fate of the Balkans" immediately after "Form a Regency Council" allows you to get a puppet war goal on Yugoslavia. Probably bugged under 1.10.1 - "Form a Regency Council" does not trigger the leader change correctly.

With historical focuses on, as {{Flag|Bulgaria}}: Complete the "Form a Regency Council" and choose the pro-Axis government. Do not complete the "Fate of the Balkans" focus. Wait until Yugoslavia wants to join Axis via the focus "Sign the Tripartite Pact". In the meantime, justify against Yugoslavia using your claims on ''Southern Serbia'' and ''Macedonia''. Join Axis but do not join any war. Then declare war but do not push into Yugoslavia. Yugoslavia will cancel the focus to join Axis and instead will complete the focus "End the Regency" which puts King Peter II into power. 
May be done in conjunction with "Master Puppeteer" (win against Yugoslavia and release the constituent states as puppets) and/or "Prussia of the Balkan" (e.g. annex Yugoslavia complete "Fate of the Balkans" after annexing Yugoslavia, help Axis against {{Flag|Soviet Union}}, help Allies against Axis, use decisions to puppet and annex {{Flag|Romania}} & {{Flag|Greece}}).

Prepare a naval invasion from the port in Northeast Siberia to Vancouver and get war goals on the Philippines and British Malaya through your focus tree.

|Become communist as normal. Take the Move to Secure the Dominion focus as soon as you switch communist, and start justifying on the Philippines, since that won't raise WT by much but still make sure the US gets involved. Move your army to Canada, making sure to spread the divisions out and declare martial law to prevent it from seceding. (It is not enough to create a front line along the border, as Nova Scotia doesn't border the US, so at least two divisions must be placed there manually.) Then start Decolonisation while you wait for the justification to finish, and install a communist government in Canada to make sure they will be friendly to you. Then, position your army along the Canadian border, and make sure to train lots of 10w 1 unit cavalry brigades, since the US cannot man their entire border with their starting army and the cavalry can simply overrun their entire country with the US not being able to do much to stop it. When the justification is finished, declare war on the Philippines which will automatically draw in the US as they are a puppet. Since Decolonisation is likely done before the invasion (to prevent civil war), it is necessary to call Canada into the war to be able to attack the US from their border. (Don't bother with moving the Royal Navy to the US; it is a quick affair to capture all ports on both coasts in the lower 48 states and then the US Navy is not much of a threat.) The achievement requires taking the focus Crush the Dream which involves an alliance with the Soviet Union, and is unavailable if the US is already a puppet or not democratic, so DO NOT CAPITULATE THE US BEFORE THE FOCUS IS FINISHED or it will be bypassed, even if other alliance members are still fighting with the US. Try to keep the rest of the Comintern out of the war against the US to prevent them from gaining war score. If the UK becomes communist, France will likely create its own Little Entente alliance, and invite the UK to it. It is important to keep WT under 50% if possible while the invasion of the US is ongoing, since above that they will be able to join factions and thus ally themselves with France, making it necessary to capitulate France as well before it is possible to puppet the US. Although, given the military capabilites by that point, and that Germany will probably invade France too, it shouldn't be a big problem to do so.

|You don't have to take the focus to release Transylvania, you can puppet it in the peace deal. Note that Transylvania needs to own all Romanian cores, meaning that if historical focus is turned on, you have to finish the war before Germany does the Second Vienna Award focus. In 1939 you should be guaranteed by both the UK and France, so you don't have to worry about the Allies. You can join the Axis or Comintern to force Romania moving some of their troops, but don't call them in, as giving Romanian land to Transylvania will require a lot of war score.
Can also be done as communist Yugoslavia. Go down the communist focus tree, make your own faction and do communist uprisings first in Albania and Bulgaria, then Romania. When communist Romania wins their civil war, justify and attack them, they will not be guaranteed by anyone, as they are communist and just fought a civil war. Puppet Transylvania in peace conference and give them all Romanian territory.

* Begin by creating and upgrading a spy agency five times to get a second agent and deleting your entire army, start turning fascist through a demagogue and then prepare for a civil war via decisions, continually use the 'Expand civil support' decision to lower stability below 50%, once below 50% stability ignite ciI1 war and rush out one cavalry division to b-line for Stockholm, the enemy should have zero divisions and very little territory so this will be enough to capitulate them.
* After the civil war ends save up 190 political power to justify on Denmark and Norway then cancel justification on Denmark and redo it, this will give you concurrent war goals to avoid them getting guaranteed by the UK, while this is happening devote your spy agency to first 'Propoganda' in Finland and then once the civil war is over switch to 'Boost Ideology' to get ready for a Fascist coup.
* Now begin preparing for war with Denmark and Norway by sitting one or two units to attack the Danish strait and sending around four units behind them with a naval invasion from the north, after justifying, expand conscription and follow the collectivist tree to be able to produce a large amount of cavalry to hold the Norwegian line.
* Once justification is complete declare war at exactly the same time to avoid guarantees from the Allies and quickly rush for victory points, you will be much stronger and Norway will leave most of their land undefended, in the peace deal annex all their land for the time being as you can release them as a puppet later on.
* Continue working on boosting fascist support in Finland and keeping their stability below 70%, once facism is above 20% begin preparing a coup in the Åland Islands, this is crucial as they will remain undefeatable by mainland Finland, once the coup is complete (and it is important to do this before late 1939 / early 1940 to avoid the Soviet Union getting involved) begin using 'Diplomatic Pressure' and 'Improve Relations' on the fascist rebels, they will survive almost indefinitely and once world tension is around 55% you will be able to create a faction with them, alternatively you can now freely justify on Finland as now they are at war which prevents them from being guaranteed, just make sure you haven't already strated the faction as that could cause them to join the Allies.
* Once the faction is created release Norway and Denmark as puppets and they will automatically join you. 

This achievement can be done with 'Med plutonium...' if you annex and release Denmark as free via the autonomy system by building in their states and lend leasing them.

Requires {{flag|Germany}} to follow the {{icon|neutrality|Monarchist}} branch of their [[German_national_focus_tree#Return_of_the_Kaiser_Sub-branch|focus tree]]. Taking Curacao from the Dutch will not give the achievement, as it is counted as part of South America.

An easy way to do this is to take Carribean land before taking Oppose Hitler. This can easily be done by conquering France before taking Oppose Hitler; either justify on the nation directly or on a nation that France is guaranteeing (at the start of the game, France will guarantee Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Yugoslavia). Have your infantry secure the Maginot Line, convert all non-infantry units you control to the starting Panzer Division, and take Army Innovations to gain 10 XP (use said XP to add 2 more motorized units to the Panzer Division template). Set up a naval invasion from Wilhelmshaven to either Dunkerque or Calais, and have your starting navy on Strike Force in the English Channel. Declare war and launch the invasion - while the starting French navy is stronger than the starting German navy, there is a brief period where the player will have superiority over the Channel. Rush the victory points and capitulate France, then take Oppose Hitler; before the focus fires off, disband your entire army and lend-lease all equipment you have to another nation that's at war the day before the focus completes; after it fires off, cancel the lend-lease, and train 6 units of Panzer Divisions (force deploy them when possible); the AI will never train new units, and the Panzer Division is stronger than the Landstrumregiment. Upon completion of the '''Our Place in the Sun''' Focus, the achievement will fire off. If one opts to conquer Britain instead of France, they can also go for [[Achievements#Operation_Sea_Lion|Operation Sea Lion]].

It can be done quickly as Japan. In the 1936 start, the Japanese fleet is immediately capable of sinking not just the HMS Hood, but the entire Royal Navy if played properly. Choose to purge the Kodoha faction and justify on the UK (or British Malaya) as soon as possible. Ask Germany for docking rights, and move your entire fleet to their port nearest to the UK. Use the bulk of your fleet as a strike force, with three groups of destroyers patrolling the naval areas around the UK. If possible, you can also use naval bombers as well for added firepower. When the justification has finished, declare war on them. If Germany invites you to the Axis you should accept for the opportunity to move your planes to their airfields. From there just keep beating the Brits and building new ships and bombers (importing Oil for fuel if needed) until your fleet sinks the Hood and unlocks the achievement.

* While the war is ongoing Follow the "Revisit Colonial Policy" branch of the national focus tree and dismantle your colonial empire, releasing a lot of puppets in the process. '''Be careful, though, as if you fail to complete the branch within 2 years of going communist, a civil war will break out!'''
* If you still don't have enough puppets, follow the rest of the national focus (the communist path) and pick either "Follow Moscow" or "The British Communist Alternative" and start puppeting the rest of Europe or annex the United States and go after the rest of the Americas.

Alternatively, playing as the {{flag|German Reich}}, you can defeat France and Britain and during the peace conference satellite all releasable nations from both of their territories.

A third way is to play as {{flag|France}}, go down the Napoleonic Path, release as many of your puppets as possible (leave some territory for your economic paths) conquer Belgium, the Netherlands and Britain (and satellite as much territory as possible from each - Belgium gives you 5 puppets from their African territory, the Netherlands gives you 3 - the Indies and both of their South American territories, and the UK gives you 40).

Take as much territory and then join their war against the allies. Alternatively, rush Subjugate the Warlords and followed by Anti-Communism. Eliminate Warlords who don't submit quickly by rushing their victory points or in the case of {{flag|Sinkiang}} rush and take as many land from them as possible. To take out {{flag|Communist China}}, use Fallback Line to station your troop some distance away from their border to draw them out. If {{flag|Shanxi}} submitted, take their troops so they don't station them on Communist China's borders. Once their troop has been drawn out, you can rush into their capital and capitulate them quickly. You should be just in time to dig in for the Japanese invasion. Capitulate the Japanese puppets and kick them out of Korea, you need to accept the Japanese surrender to get the achievement. All that is left will be using Political Power to do the 3 steps process in order to integrate each of the warlords that submitted.

*** A nation in a faction with {{flag|France}}
| One possible way to achieve this is refuse {{flag|Germany}}'s Remilitarization of the Rhineland while {{flag|United Kingdom}} refuses it. This will cause a minor Civil War in France. Place Divisions on the Maginot and around Northern and Central France where the civil war spawns. As soon as war starts with {{flag|Germany}}, Capitulate the civil war first and push into {{flag|Germany}}. Once {{flag|Germany}} capitulates, annex everything or puppet Germany. Then follow the focus tree until [[French_national_focus_tree#Little_Entente|Little Entente]].

Another window to strike at Germany early is during Sudetenland crisis. Following the Little Entente path will get you Czechoslovakia as your faction member. Try to get as many of the potential members in as possible, if you can get UK to join you, you are all set and you can take it slow from there. You can get Republican Spain to join you if you choose to get involved in the Spanish Civil War but be mindful of your stability to not start a civil war of your own. It will be easier to push into Germany when they are distracted by Poland and Czechoslovakia, but you do not need them to survive so don't fret if they capitulated. If you are lucky, a civil war in Germany might trigger in which case you can invite the rebel Germany to your faction. 

A third way is to turn off La Resistance. Flip to Fascism (unlike Utilize the Leagues, Right Wing Rhetoric is not mutually exclusive with Review Foreign Policy), form the Little Entente, and take the focus to Invite Italy to your faction. As long as Italy has not completed Pact of Steel, they will accept. After inviting Italy, during the Sudetenland Crisis, deny Germany the land, and then when they declare war on Czechoslovakia, join the war and call Italy in.

| Rush the fascist focuses. Upon taking "Utilize the Leagues", you will have access to decisions of boosting fascist and non-aligned popularity. Never take "Unleash La Cagoule" decision. Just take fascist demagogue and spam "Rally the Leagues" decision. Because if your stability drops below 30%, the civil war will start. In the mean time you can pick any focuses you want and plan the naval invasion of Britain. Once you have 50% of fascist and non-aligned combined popularity, you can continue working on the fascist focuses. Take the "Political unity" focus as soon as possible, it will remove the chance of spawning the civil war. After that pick "Towards the new Europe" branch. Rush the focus tree until you will do "Expand to the Suez" focus. Immediately declare war on Britain and annex them. Your starting army is strong enough to easily destroy Britain.   

You don't need the DLC, join Axis, paradrop and naval invade UK, eventually your paratroops will get a port randomly (just move your air units between regions), or you and Germany and Italy and Nationalist Spain will overwhelm. If you are really struggling and tension is low enough (below 25%) invade Ireland first.

* Make sure you don't bring your allies (Especially Italy, which will take your land unless you use all your war score on Poland and France)
* Paradropping troops prevents this achievement.
* Organize your troops on the frontiers with France and Poland, but divide one with all your light tanks. This army should be next to Danzig. Merge all your ships in one single army and place it in one of your ports at the west of Denmark with the order ''naval invasion support'' over the two regions between France and Germany. Prepare all your planes to attack on Poland.
* Start the war. Don't invite your allies and <u>don't activate your battle plans</u>, except your light tanks army over Danzig.
* After getting Danzig, move your light tanks to a port at the west of Denmark and make a naval invasion against France with ten of the eleven divisions. Send each one to a different coastal province of France, the ten nearest to Belgium. The naval invasion will be ready in seven days, and your navy with ''naval invasion support'' mission will be enough to get the naval superiority you need (anyway, support it from the air with fighters, CAS, bombers and so on with the order ''air superiority'', ''interception'' and ''naval strike'').
* When your tanks arrive France, change the planes order to support troops over their territory and move the tanks quick to the victory points (focusing Paris). Try to avoid direct confrontations with their troops if possible. France will surrend quick.
* Repeat the naval invasion, in this case against UK. Don't forget to change the regions of the planes to help your troops. Once in UK, focus London and other victory points. Again, avoid direct fights with enemies if you can.
* When UK and France have surrended and you have Danzig, the war will end. Take all the territory.
* This strategy works most of times, but not all. Sometimes Poland attack you from other provinces and cause some thousands casualties, so you will have to repeat the game.

The USA starts with the first Georgia, while the other two; Georgia and South Georgia, are owned by the Soviet Union and United Kingdom. 
* Because of this, collaborating with the Axis is the simplest route to achieving this. Help the axis capitulate the allies and Comintern, and grab South Georgia (an island off the coast of Argentina) from the British, and Georgia (a Soviet state in the Caucasus region) from the USSR. ''Reaffirm Monroe Doctrine'' focus unlocks a decision to ask the UK for, notably, South Georgia.
* An alternative strategy is to turn communist, complete the national focus "Unholy Alliance", join the Comintern. This will cause a decision named "Join the Unions" to appear, which can only be taken once the Soviet Union is at 80% surrender progress and will make the US annex the Soviet Union. When the "USS Panay sunk" event fires, take the option to start a war with Japan and defeat them to get them out of the way. When Germany attacks the Soviet Union, do not join the war and wait until Germany forces the Soviet Union to 80% surrender progress, then take the decision, thus earning you the second Georgia. After that, use your industrial capacity to build up a military, conquer Germany and the Axis and finally, start a war with the Allies ({{flag|United Kingdom}} and {{flag|France}}), defeat them and annex everything, including South Georgia.

If the Turks refuse to attack, pull away the majority of your forces, and then send them back when they start to attack what was left behind. After doing this 3 times or so, send 9 of your soldiers to Istanbul, cutting off the Turkish forces from supplies. Use your forces to mop up the Turkish forces trapped in the Bosphorus, then have them retreat back to the starting border. Repeat until the Turks have little manpower left in the field, then push forward and capitulate them.

| The straightforward, but boring and slow, approach is to defeat the Axis, then go to war with the Comintern and defeat them (note that the PRC will declare war on China one year after the end of the war with Japan, so you can use the focus to get China democratic and add them to the Allies before that war starts) - this should add lots of countries to the Allies, and then trigger coups everywhere you can. Once there's been a civil war, the winner has created world tension and you can justify against them.  It takes a very long time, and, once you've won WWII, it's obviously going to work eventually, so it's very boring.

| At the start of the game, get both a fascist and communist demagogue and switch to fascism via civil war. This will allow you to quickly get manpower bonuses from the fascist political tree as well as joining the Axis to avoid a German attack, while communist support builds up for later (remove fascist demagogue after civil war but ensure communist support stays below 60% to avoid another civil war). 
Build up your army to about 15 infantry to naval invade southern Sweden (produce cheap submarines to ensure naval supremacy) and create some cavalry divisions for defending naval invasions and the Swedish border, which can also be built up with forts. 
Declare war on Sweden after your communist support reaches 50%, then call in your allies and switch to communism. With German support, capitulating Sweden should be straightforward and they will likely attack through your border rather than navally invading allowing for you to occupy all the land including Stockholm.

Alternatively, you can also do this without joining any faction. Just turn either fascist or communist. Doesn't really matter which one. After that frabricate your wargoal against Sweden and put a few divisions on a naval order for the Svealand provence. You (only) need Stockholm for the achievement. Sweden should have put most of their divisions on your border, but only rarely do they put any in stockholm. Once the war starts you should have naval supremacy for a few hours. Enough for your invasions to be able to be launched. Even if Sweden intercepts one divisions, they never will be able to get them all. So once you land either directly in Stockholm or land near it and then take it, the achievement pops up.

After that take the focuses "Enemies on All Fronts" and "Pre-Empt Western Intervention." This focus gives wargoals for the UK, France and the USA. The perfect timing for this (the Pre-Empt Western Intervention focus) is when Germany goes for the Danzig or War focus. Improve your relations with Germany.

While waiting out the time till 1945 you can play pure defense or just help Germany conquer Western-Europe (play it correctly and you can get all of Belgium and Luxembourg and Repudiate the Treaty of London) and perhaps the Soviet Union. 
Another option is to use the national focuses and join either Allies or Comintern ''before'' Germany justifies on you (Normally 1940). This will make faction members move divisions to your border with Germany, thus making your defense somewhat easier. If possible, ask your faction members for as many expeditionary forces as possible. Also, don't forget to do the "Prepare the Inundation Lines" focus because it will give you land forts which makes it even harder for Germany to attack you. 
For a greater challenge; take the non-aligned path, but the House of Orange back in power, and try to hold off the Wehrmacht on your own. Do to this rush down the Army tree in order to begin your war on pacifism as early as possible. Doing this will also give you buffs to fortification Building - build some on either side of the Waddenzee, making sure to include the three border territories in Freisland - two East of Amsterdam, one at the neck of the Waddenzee. Make simple infantry and artillery divisions to hold this line, then spam the equipment. Then 'simply' hold the line. You can complete the Zuiderzee works at your leisure.

| If {{icon|bfb}} Battle for the Bosporus is active, the achievement can only be done patch 1.10.2 or later.
Change government to fascism as quickly as possible (using the Megali Idea if {{icon|bfb}} is active). Justify on Yugoslavia and Albania, timing it so the justifications complete right after the Anschluss (February 1938 with Historical Focus). Join the Axis, which will consist of Germany alone. Declare both wars simultaneously, drawing Romania and Italy into a war with Germany. Get as much war participation as possible and puppet both in the peace conference. You can then proceed to defeat Turkey and the Soviet Union alongside the Axis.
Pupetting your targets is not difficult, as Germany prefers to take land for itself. The only one to watch for is Romania: if the Turkish Straits are closed, Germany will have no land or sea route to Romania and might puppet instead.

Alternatively you can temporarily fight in the Allies' side. Go down the left side focus and choose to work with the Fascists. Once Restoring the Megali Idea focus is reached, start it and choose to invite Italy along to prevent the loss of stability. Do not follow up to Terror and Fear yet, pick any other focus for now and soon you will get the Anatolian Fascist coup. As soon as you turn Fascist, justify on Bulgaria immediately. Puppet Bulgaria and follow up with Terror and Fear to start the war with Turkey and Romania. Do not call Bulgaria to war yet, focus on defeating Turkey first. Once you defeat Turkey and restore Byzantium, you can start working on Romania, dig in on the Bulgarian border and let the Romanian troops destroy themselves in the offensive, then start pushing in. You can start justifying on Hungary now if you wish. Alternatively you can prepare some transport planes earlier and convert your mountaineers to paratroopers, once you have captured Bucharest you can send the paratroopers to snatch some victory points in the north and west to instantly capitulate Romania. Puppet or annex Romania. If you justified on Hungary, they should be an easier opponent than Romania and Turkey unless you are too late and they already joined the Axis. Sooner or later Italy will declare on you, do not call your puppets to war. If you didn't join the Allies you can start your own faction with Yugoslavia. Kick the Italians out of Albania and if you get an opening, try launching a naval invasion at Italy and capitulate them to get more war score. You should be able to puppet Italy in the peace deal. You can then prepare the war with the USSR. If you somehow managed to keep your Democratic popularity above 60% such as by hiring the Social Democrat advisor at the start or taking The Birthplace of Democracy focus beforehand, you can return to Democratic at any time after this. This way you can guarantee Iraq, Iran, and Afghanistan and you can join in the fight and invite them to your faction once the USSR declare war on them. Otherwise, you can justify on USSR after you are done with the Axis, but it is best to wait until they declare war on Iran so they cannot focus their entire forces on you. Having USSR as a Supervised State will count for the achievement.

|{{icon|yes}} Conquered all of {{flag|China}}, {{flag|Manchukuo}} and {{flag|Japan}} not including the states of Hong Kong(326) , Macau (729) and Guangzhouwan (728) . This includes all of the warlords.
| The strongest warlord is the {{flag|Guangxi Clique}} due to their starting resources. Due to your early equipment deficits and lack of research capability but very high manpower, focus on getting as much of your manpower onto the field as quickly as possible. DON'T force the Xi'an incident or China could refuse and the Chinese United Front won't form at all - wait to join later. With your troops you can then join and help China against the Japanese by placing defensive divisions on their coastline - you will need a high number to be able to repel better-equipped Japanese invasions. Go for Root Out Corruption, Power Struggle and Executive Yuan. This will give you enough political power to do Power Struggle propaganda in three states to Chiang's two and will quickly put you on top. Push the Japanese out of China and Korea, while building a fleet and/or air force to cross the Sea of Japan.
The focus "Subjugate the Warlords" gives a fixed 50% chance to puppet each of the warlords (even if they are in a different faction). You can then annex those who accept via decisions, and declare war against the ones who don't. Communist China may pursue a civil war with you while you are still fighting the Japanese, and you may not be able to use the anti-communism focus against them once you are in a faction together. It is important to deal with them early, however, as if left to the late game they can join the Allies and this will force you to fight on multiple fronts with the British Raj.

{{flag|Sinkiang}} is an other option, as it can immediately join the Comintern and the USSR will never take land in China.

Once you have safely fortified the East Indies from Japanese attacks, either focus on Germany to reconquer your home territory or focus on Japan and finish them off to gain some resources and factories.

With {{icon|dod}} DLC(method one)
* Turn Communist, join Comintern and take Romania to have a border with Soviet Union
* Build up Sudetenland to lvl 7 forts and don't give up Sudetenland
* When Germany attacks hold on till Soviets arrive and beat them (if you are quick Italy will not join Axis)
* Take the best Germany provinces (by resources and IC), build up your forces and take Italy, Balkans and France (avoid fighting with Allies if possible)
* Build up your navy, attack the Allies and island hop to Australia
* It is easier with historical AI turned off (Hungary can take Austria and/or ally with Italy, France may not join the Allies)

With {{icon|dod}} DLC(method two):
* Turn fascist, justify on Austria and Yugoslavia ASAP(don't choose any focus to get extra PP) - make sure both justifications finish at around the same time to avoid guarantees (playing on nonhistorical will reduce guarantee chances)
* During your justifications, take the focus 'Trust with the West' to get rid of the Romanian guarantee on you, pulling Romania in the war also
* In peace deal, annex the states you need to form Austria-Hungary
* You can then justify and annex hungary to form AH, giving you cores(manpower + extra factories)
* You can then join Japan's faction and invade from their territory

* Alternatively just join Axis, get military access from Japan (when they war on Allies) and naval invade from Japan (VERY easy)

Paratroopers method:
* Switch to fascist through civil war
* Justify on Dutch East Indies
* Join Axis, declare war, wait a few days for Netherlands to send more troops to the frontline, paradrop on victory points (don't call Germany)
* Build an air base in Aru Islands
* Join the war when Germany attacks Poland, paradrop into Northen Territory, take Canberra (don't call East Indies)

* Expand your army, wait for German attack to Poland and prepare to fight against Soviet Union.
* After Molotov-Ribbentrop pact signed and Poland capitulated, Soviets will take Eastern part of it. You can justify on them directly or guarantee Finland to enter the war then as defending country. 
* Defeat Soviets alone or with German help. If fighting with Germans (in alliance or not), make bigger war score than they, because at peace conference Germany could first take all Eastern Poland and it'd be unavailable to get Polish land without struggle with Axis. 
* At peace conference take at least one Soviet and Polish core territory.

* Best done by joining the Comintern, as the USSR will never take or puppet any land in China.
* This achievement requires Hong Kong and Guangzhouwan to be taken in a peace deal. If Japan occupy them and you take them back, you might be able to snatch them in the peace deal, otherwise you will have to defeat the Allies.
* Alternatively, take the Fascist path and take the focus "Join the Axis". Then, put troops on the border with Poland and help Germany take out Poland, Netherlands, Belgium, and France to get as much war score as possible. Then, use paratroopers to land in Dover and send your army into mainland England to finish the war. In the peace deal, make sure you give Hong Kong and Guangzhouwan to your provisional government. After defeating the Allies, you should have a large enough army and economy to take on China and Japan yourself. Then, give all Chinese territory to Portuguese China and the achievement will be yours.
* Taking British Raj as a puppet is highly recommended to invade through Sinkiang and Yunnan. Also, having Britain as puppet is essential to get naval supremacy over Japan.

| To be Ottoman Empire you need to go far left of focus tree and choose Adnan Menderes after "Hold Our First Multi-Party Election". This one requires one to be in the winning side against both Axis and Allies. Easiest way is to disable La Resistance and start boosting non-aligned to Russia and USA from the beginning of game and right after concluding civil war against Kemalists. You will need to stage well timed coups against Russia and USA in order to have rebellion in your faction instead of Axis(they shouldn't be in a war against another faction), a good time to start against Russia is around when Italia joins Axis and a few months later to the USA(they both should have <80 stability at the time if you boosted non-aligned enough but it can differ sometimes). In the meantime you can annex or puppet Greece and Romania with naval invasions with "Reclaim the Makedonyalı Sanjak" claim. Continue with "Press the Austro-Hungarian Claim" focus to be able to create factions. Justify against russia and declare before coup is complete, when Russian coup is completed invite rebellion to your faction. You just need to hold your line and not let non-aligned Russia get capitulated(you don't need war participation, rebellion will have all russia after Germany capitulates Russia). You will also need to send a lot of divisions to help USA rebellion so it's better to choose a city from pasific side to start coup(Axis should have Suez Canal by now and you can ask for access while being at war against Russia). Like with Russia, you need to justify against USA and declare before coup is finished. After Democratic USA and Communist Russia is capitulated you will have 2 most powerful nations in your faction. Your faction can win any war against anyone. Keep an eye on non-aligned Russia's division count and declare war to Axis when you are ready, after that either get control of capitals via naval invasion/paradrop or ask control from your allies.

| Can be done in conjunction with the "It's 1812 All Over Again" achievement as Canada. After capitulating and annexing the United States, prepare a naval invasion force and fleet to attack the UK. Annexing the US may help industrially and the Send in the Zombies focus may help with the recruitable population. If Iceland gets released, it may be necessary to justify against them. Try to take the UK before Germany or Italy tries a naval invasion. If the peace conference triggers before the achievement does, try to annex all of Great Britain as the other Axis members may take the required territory. It may be advisable to create a faction with Mexico instead of joining the Axis to make it harder for Germany to take British states in the peace conference.

A puppeted Yugoslavia can be integrated with its constituent states released as puppets for this achievement, or you can seize Macedonia and Southern Serbia from them via descision. These states can make the puppets Macedonia and Serbia. In order to get states to join your faction via decision it is important to have more manpower deployed to the field, and puppet expeditionary forces contribute to this number.

| Go the Kemalist route through the Etatism and Peace at Home focuses. Take the Silent Workhorse advisor and use the Secularism decision whenever available to block the expansion of your Islamist rivals. The Türk Ulusu focus will pacify the Kurdish states, while the Islamist opposition can be dealt with through the Counter-Fundamentalist Operation or compromise decisions (as long as the Kemalist remain loyal). You do not have to go to war and simply need enough political power to repeat the decisions. The achievement will trigger when all Islamic states are Placated, and the Kurdish states are either at Separatist Fatigue or cored.

钢铁之心4》有132个不同的''成就''，都使用了Steam的成就机制。成就在游戏中没有效果；成就只是在游戏中弹出，然后根据游戏的版本添加到玩家的Steam或Xbox档案中。通过进入游戏的[http://steamcommunity.com/stats/394360/achievements/?l=english global achievements at Steam]，可以看到按成功完成每项成就的用户比例排序的成就。

每项成就的难度各不相同；有些成就非常容易（例如加入一个派别），而有些则比较困难（例如以{{国旗|澳大利亚}}的身份征服{{国旗|捷克斯洛伐克}}或以{{国旗|法国}}的身份到达1948年而不曾投降）。下面的列表按照维基编辑评估的难度级别对各种成就进行分组（未分类--UC--成就尚未评估）。

成就只能在单人[[Ironman]]游戏中获得，以1936年为起点，在 "普通"、"老兵 "或 "精英 "难度下获得。(30 Minutes of Hel和Don't Die for Your Country只能在1939年的开始日期完成)。只要该版本中存在上述成就，就可以在玩老版本的游戏时获得这些成就。它们也可以在''历史AI焦点''设置为关闭时获得。{注：没有 "结束日期"，游戏可以无限期地继续下去。}

如果[[校验和]]被改变了，就不可能获得成就--无论是通过篡改游戏文件，还是通过使用影响游戏机制的MOD来运行游戏（图形MOD不影响校验和），或者是损坏的安装。

如果你没有BoTB，你可以只做正常的内战技巧。删除你所有的军队，做 "政治努力 "的重点，用你的PP雇佣一个共产主义革命者，每天支持0.10+的共产主义。然后，不要做任何重点。用你的PP来扩大民事支持，但要准备好一个骑兵师来部署。当你达到低于50%的稳定性时，点燃内战并部署骑兵师。冲向胜利点，获得胜利!

*一旦希腊和罗马尼亚成为共产主义国家（1940年初），进行 "埋葬过去的怨恨 "的重点工作，匆忙统一。与意大利签署NAP，这样他们就不会对希腊宣战，也不会对苏联宣战，这样他们就不会为贝萨拉比亚辩解。如果你吞并了所有这三个国家，你就只剩下被轴心国控制的国家了。可以延续到 "巴尔干地区的普鲁士 "成就中。
*虽然成就工具箱没有提到，但你需要土耳其在巴尔干地区的领土来触发它。

* 在内战结束后，积攒了190个政治力量来为丹麦和挪威辩护，然后取消对丹麦的辩护并重做，这将为你提供同步的战争目标，以避免他们得到英国的保证，在这一过程中，将你的间谍机构首先用于芬兰的 "宣传"，然后一旦内战结束，转到 "促进意识形态"，为法西斯政变做好准备。
* 现在开始为与丹麦和挪威的战争做准备，派一到两支部队进攻丹麦海峡，并在他们身后派四支部队从北方进行海上入侵，在论证之后，扩大征兵，并遵循集体主义原则，以便能够生产大量的骑兵来坚守挪威的防线。
* 一旦论证完成，就在同一时间宣战，以避免盟国的担保，并迅速冲刺胜利点数，你将变得更加强大，挪威将留下大部分土地不作防御，在和平协议中暂时吞并他们所有的土地，因为你可以在以后释放他们作为傀儡。
* 继续努力提高法西斯在芬兰的支持率，使他们的稳定性低于70%，一旦法西斯主义超过20%，就开始准备在奥兰群岛发动政变，这是至关重要的，因为他们将保持在芬兰本土无法战胜的状态，一旦政变完成（重要的是在1939年底/1940年初之前完成，以避免苏联的介入），就开始对法西斯叛军使用 "外交压力 "和 "改善关系"。他们几乎可以无限期地生存下去，一旦世界紧张局势达到55%左右，你就可以与他们建立一个派别，或者你现在可以自由地对芬兰进行辩解，因为现在他们处于战争状态，这使他们无法得到保证，只是要确保你还没有建立起这个派别，因为这可能导致他们加入盟国。
* 一旦派别建立起来，将挪威和丹麦作为傀儡释放，他们会自动加入你。

|作为卡洛斯主义的西班牙，在西班牙内战后，冲向[[民族主义_西班牙_国家_焦点_树#重新夺取_西班牙_荷兰|重新夺取西班牙荷兰]]焦点，拿下比荷卢。在法国北部和南部边境各拥有约24个师，并在德国与法国开战时向其宣战。屈服法国，对英国发动海上入侵。一旦英国投降，在和平协议中拿下直布罗陀。
也可以用{{icon|mtg}}非常容易地完成。如果关闭了历史上的AI焦点，那么也可以用{{flag|United Kingdom}}的焦点树的[[British_national_focus_tree#Revisit_Colonial_Policy|Revisit Colonial Policy]]分支，其中包含 "从有争议的领土撤出 "这一焦点，这将把直布罗陀免费送给{{flag|Spain}}，同时成为一个核心国家。如果这发生在内战期间，直布罗陀可能不会被送给玩家的西班牙，但一旦内战胜利，直布罗陀就会被转让。

*''invalid_for_danzig_achievement''标志在德国向法国宣战时起火。
* 1.9.0版中的错误：作为德国，从未对法国或波兰宣战，而法国翻转了法西斯主义，成就就会启动。
* 法国必须在不触发内战的情况下翻转法西斯主义。
* 在非历史模式下游戏，沿着焦点树走，直到 "要求苏台德地区"。如果捷克斯洛伐克拒绝，你将得到一个针对他们的战争目标。法国和罗马尼亚将为捷克斯洛伐克提供担保，因此，当你对它们宣战时，你将与它们开战。把你的部队放在与这三个国家的边境上，对捷克斯洛伐克发动战争。无论什么原因，这都不会影响国旗''invalid_for_danzig_achievement''。罗马尼亚、法国和捷克斯洛伐克不会在同一个派别，所以你每次打败其中一个国家都会有一个和平协议。要征服法国，只需将你所有的船只合并成一支军队，在他们和你之间的两个海区执行 "海军入侵支援 "任务。进行登陆，占领巴黎和其他一些胜利点。他们会很快投降。在法国的和平协议上，让他们成为傀儡。当这三个国家被打败后，你将获得成就。

另外，只要有了政治权力，就可以对南斯拉夫进行论证，以获得类似的效果，因为罗马尼亚、法国和捷克斯洛伐克都是他们的保障。如果走这条路，也可以和[[成就#Our_Other_Place_In_The_Sun|Our Other Place in the Sun]]结合起来，如果在击败法国、捷克斯洛伐克和罗马尼亚后恢复了德皇室。

# 你需要把重点放在统一英国圈上
# 你需要吞并美国所有的核心州，或者是傀儡美国，让它拥有所有的核心州。如果你要与其他国家分享战绩，傀儡美国可能是更好的选择。
# 一旦你吞并/傀儡了美国，就会出现一个决定，即建立美国君主制。
# 重要的是选择 "坚持皇家婚姻"，这样你就可以组建美国君主制。

|在日本人即将进攻之前，不要接受与中国共产党的合作。然后，组建中国统一战线，接受所有邀请。迅速赶往朝鲜，把他们赶出大陆。在他们提出和平后，接受它，并将共产党中国从你的派系中踢出去。在他们对你发动战争之前，尽快向他们宣布并吞他们。对其他派别的成员也要这样做，最后留下新江。解散这个派别，在德国向东推进后向苏联宣战。加入轴心国。他们在西部的所有部队会很容易投降。拿下尽可能多的领土，然后加入他们对盟国的战争。或者，急于征服军阀，然后进行反共产主义。通过冲刺胜利点数，消灭那些不迅速屈服的军阀；如果是{{flag|Sinkiang}}，则冲刺并尽可能多地夺取他们的土地。要消灭{{flag|Communist China}}，请使用回撤线，将你的部队驻扎在离他们边界一定距离的地方，以吸引他们。如果{{flag|Shanxi}}提交了，就拿下他们的部队，这样他们就不会在中国共产党的边界上驻扎。一旦他们的部队被引出来，你就可以冲进他们的首都，迅速俘虏他们。你应该正好可以为日本人的入侵挖坑。俘虏日本傀儡并把他们赶出朝鲜，你需要接受日本人的投降以获得成就。剩下的就是用政治力量来完成3个步骤，以整合每个提交的军阀。
