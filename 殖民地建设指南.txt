本指南是关于[[colony|殖民地建]]设的终极指南，可用于游戏内任何阶段。

== 殖民地建设的一般原则 ==

一个高效的基地可以使殖民者在''完成工作''的同时''保持心情愉悦''。殖民者必须能够及时完成分配给他们的任务，而基地也要使殖民者在工作和生活中感到舒适愉悦。基地也应能保障安全，但这可能是最容易做到的部分。
一个有效的基地使您的殖民者能够完成工作并且保持快乐。他们必须能够及时完成分配的工作，并且基地必须舒适宜人，才能工作和居住。基地也应足够''安全''，但这可能是最简单的部分。

=== 完成工作：减少路途 ===

由于建筑物和储物区占用一定的空间，殖民者在完成工作的过程中往往要来回奔波。为了尽量减少在路途中消耗的时间，在基地的建设中要首先确定哪些方面更为重要。然后再以其为中心建设基地。

最重要的原则是:'''不要将居住区放在基地的中心'''。卧室应放在殖民地边缘：在不需要睡觉的白天，它们只会碍事。

此外，很难提前计划出你到底需要几张床，除非你做出来了限制殖民者数量这样艰难的决定(至于其他人是如何被失踪就不用提示了吧)。如果你的生活区被其他建筑包围，那么再想增加床铺就只能另建生活区。长此以往，基地布局会日益混乱，防御也将更加困难。

娱乐室与餐厅也不应建在中心，建议放在卧室附近。娱乐和就餐大多在早晨和傍晚进行。殖民者很少在白天去这些地方。

虽然都是有床的房间，可监狱和医疗室应该放在更靠近中心的位置。医疗室和监狱需要频繁地访问，因为要照顾/喂养病人和"贵客"。如果越狱者位于基地中央，那么越狱事件就更容易处理。

保证有关联的区域相互靠近:厨房、冷藏室、仓库和工作区。某些区域被访问得''非常''频繁，例如冷藏室。缩短进出这些地方的路径。
=== 漂亮点 ===

殖民者不喜欢生活在混乱和肮脏的环境中。他们不想走在令人作呕的地方。例如，请勿将垃圾堆放在殖民地主要走道旁边。

无法避免的丑陋区域可以通过放置装饰物来抵消。制作具有高美观度的雕塑物，并将其安放在丑陋环境中。例如，你可以在主要仓库的各个位置放置一些''大雕塑''。这可以使其保持中等美观甚至达到''美丽''。像所有家具一样，雕塑不必非要放在屋顶区和室内，因此可以放置在任何地方。光滑的地板和墙壁以及地毯可以有效提高美观度（每块地板+2美观度），但制作时需要消耗大量的工作时间和资源。

舒适的家具非常重要。拥有一个好木匠（具有很高的“建筑”技能），并让他们在模板上（尤其是床和椅子）上制作所有家具。在所有工作台的前面放置餐椅（它们既“美观”''又'' “舒适”）；它们无法提高工作者的工作速度，但可以使使用者心情更好。

在建筑方面，最好让你最优秀的建筑师优先于"艺术性创作"，如家具这类有质量乘数的物品。第二梯队的建筑师可以做些如铺地毯、打磨地板、筑墙之类的工作。这些建筑没有质量乘数，建筑技能只影响建造成功率和工作速度。可惜的是，你几乎只能依靠 [https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=725219116  mods] 来实现以上计划。

=== 安全第一 ===

基地安全不难保障，只要你的平面规划紧凑。有一种简单的战术是用墙围起整个基地，故意留下一个敌人必定会攻击的弱点。如果你给敌人留下了这样一个可以进入你基地的机会，他们即使承受风险也会尽力抓住它。如果有一个长走廊，你可以将它作为天然掩体。方法是在每一个门中安排一个射手，然后向袭来的敌人射击。这是一种有效的防御手段。它甚至可以防御中型袭击同时不需要任何特殊防御建筑。

在高难度下，可能需要更高级的战术如："杀人盒"与自动机枪塔。

一般而言，我们希望袭击者''找上门''。这样能避免与他们在野外作战。在交战之前，应将围攻部队和纵火狂引诱到基地附近。

== 基地基本类型 ==

以下是构建基地的不同方式。

== 基本结构 ==

殖民地中，不同的结构可以满足不同的需求。地图在生成时会产生旧结构。有时它们只是一段墙壁，有时是缺了几段的矩形。如果位置合适，它们很适合作为一个起点。这样可以有效减少游戏开始时的工作量，并降低你一无所有时的生存压力。

=== 存储 ===

现在，我们应当将第一个建好的房间作为储物室。因为放在室外与暴露的物品可能会变质。放置一块覆盖整个房间内大部分区域的存储区，门旁的空间除外。因为有时搬运者可能会意外将物品掉落在门上，从而使其保持打开状态——这样也不安全。您可以设置多个较小的存储区，通过允许不同物品来更好地管理它们。您的储藏室应建在工作区附近，以最大程度地减少原材料的运输时间。

请特别注意易燃物品，例如[[化学燃料]]和[[迫击炮弹]]。因为它们可能会炸毁并烧光您的全部库存。将它们分开并放置在石头制成的隔间中，并远离基地的外部，以防止[[末日火箭发射器]]击中它们。因为这种武器可以炸穿墙壁。在此处放置一个泡沫灭火器，以防止火灾点燃弹药。

游戏中期，可以添加贸易信标来与轨道贸易商交易。

=== 多人宿舍 ===

多人宿舍是一个由多人共享同一个睡眠空间的屋子。在游戏初期，它让你更容易安排你的殖民者。但它也有不便之处，例如行走的人会打扰到在睡觉的人，单身狗喜欢一个人睡。睡袋和床这类家具可以提高舒适度。这类家具的质量越好，使用者醒的越快。此外还可以提升他们的工作效率。一旦基础设施建好，就应当升级你的殖民地来为殖民者提供私人卧室。你可以将多人宿舍转换为其他区域，如多人监狱与医疗室。

您可以通过使用雕塑、漂亮的地板、温度控制工具和高品质的家具（如梳妆台和床头柜）等方法来升级多人宿舍，使其提供积极的情绪修正。其中床头柜可以一次增加多个床的舒适度。

殖民者喜欢醒来后就吃饭。一开始，您可以在他们的睡眠点旁边放一张桌子和椅子，但是请尽量将它们重新放置在其他地方，因为殖民者进食时会干扰其他在睡觉的人。居住区完工后，在靠近卧室的地方建造餐厅。

=== 卧室 ===
{{see also|Space}}

[[File:Bedroom.png|thumb|right|General 通用卧室，适用于游戏的所有阶段。温度通过右侧的走廊平衡。这个房间有足够的空间用于临时工作台的建设。]]

卧室是私人的睡眠空间，可消除其他人员造成的“睡眠被打扰”情绪损失，并提供比多人宿舍更好的情绪奖励。夫妻会希望一起睡，并且不会打扰对方的睡眠。但是，他们需要一张双人床。

随着基地的扩张，建议你通过以下方式升级你的卧室:
* 为了增加舒适性，给床添加[[床头柜]]，并把一个[[梳妆台]]在房间里。较高品质的家具可提供更高的舒适度，而较高品质的床则可提高''休息效率''。让你最优秀的建筑师建造家具。
** 空间设置为25方格，这为在卧室中放置临时工作台留出了足够的空间，在扩展基地时很有用。更大卧室的效率更低，因为增加的墙壁和地板导致成本上升。
** 落地灯
** 漂亮的物品，例如花盆和雕塑；越多越好，但不要超过上限。
** 高品质地板，例如地毯。它可以增加美观度。如果您可以打磨地板（和墙壁）（通常是在山下），那它比地毯更好：它具有相同的美观度，但不易燃且制造成本低得多。您需要一个优秀的建筑师，因为打磨地板需要大量的工作时间。
** 供暖与制冷；通过通道进行供暖与制冷要容易实现得多。它使用[[通风孔]]使其温度与卧室保持一致。

殖民者经常随身携带一份食物。如果没有桌子，它们就会在地板上吃饭，这会造成心情减益。根据基地整体布局，你可以：
* 就近建设餐厅。
* 在卧室区附近的户外搭建一套座椅。
* 将座椅放在卧室内。但是记得关闭桌子的"聚会地点"选项。因为可能有寻求[[娱乐]]的人进入他人的卧室导致睡觉的人被打扰。

==== 特殊情况 ====

"苦行者"想要低美观度的房间。要满足这项需求，最好不要为其安装地板与装饰品，同时缩小房屋面积。但仍然应该为该殖民者提供床头柜和梳妆台，因为即使苦行者也喜欢舒适地入睡。还有一种硬核的方法，就是将风干的动物尸体放到其卧室里，这会使美观度大大降低。

游戏初期，很难满足“贪心”殖民者的需求。但随着基地扩张以及日益富有，提供一个令人印象深刻的卧室应该不成问题。

“妒忌”殖民者是最难管理的。特别是当他们不止一个的时候。能最终让所有人都感到开心的最佳方法是仅使用质量相同的标准卧室。
{{clear}}

=== 相邻区域 ===

冷藏室、厨房、餐厅和娱乐室通常彼此相邻。厨房应该与其他房间隔离开来，以减少走动造成的污垢。餐厅和厨房应当与冷藏室连接，这样吃饭的时候就不必穿过厨房。

如果聚会地点附近有椅子，那么聚会和婚礼就会在这里举行。在此期间殖民者不会吃东西。如果这里靠近冷藏室的话，他们就可以很方便地拿食物到餐桌上吃。

==== 冷藏室 ====

[[File:Freezer coolers placement.png|thumb|right|400px|建在山边的简易冷藏室，使用了一个制冷机。]]

[[File:Special freezer.png|thumb|right|该冷藏室的制冷机位于中央而不是边缘。只有中央的方格未盖屋顶。绿色区域代表屋顶，这也是冷冻室的“冷”区域。中心的无屋顶方格为室外温度。]]

冷藏室一般用来存放[[raw food|生食]]、植物和新鲜的尸体。无论任何阶段，冷藏室都必不可少，因为肉和制作出的食物会很快变质。同样，如果没有受掌控的冷藏室，就无法保证新鲜食物的储备。

在大部分地区，可以使用[[cooler|制冷机]]创建冷藏室。虽然食物在零度以下即会冻结，但冷藏室的[[温]]度仍然应当设置为-5摄氏度以下。因为每当殖民者进出冷藏室时，它的温度都会变化。另一方面，在寒冷地区就可以不使用制冷机，因为室外温度已经够低，只要使用通风孔就够了。

可以将[[butcher spot|屠宰点]]和[[butcher table|屠宰台]]放在冷藏室内。这是因为屠宰是一个间断、快速的工作，可以承担一些工作速度损失。其他工作点，如[[crafting spot|手工加工点]]，应放置在冷藏室外。这样即可以避免工作速度损失，也可以更靠近其原材料。

无论如何，都'''不要'''把炉灶放在冷藏室。除了工作速度损失之外，炉灶需要干净的环境，而冷藏室由于人流量大和动物尸体造成大量血迹，无法满足这个要求。

建议在冷藏室靠近门处建立一个高优先级、只允许[[meal|食品]]的存储区。这样厨师就可以更快的将食品放在这里，节约路上的时间。同样可以在冷藏室内设置肉和植物的存储区。当高优先级的存储区中出现空位时，负责搬运的殖民者和动物会将低优先级存储区中的合适物品搬过去。

[[Nutrient paste dispenser|营养膏合成机]]可以被当做墙壁。通常将其主体与进料口放在冷藏室中，激活点朝向餐厅。

制冷机的位置至关重要。因为它们的耐久度非常低，只有100点。这使得它们成为墙壁上最薄弱的点，突袭者很容易从这里突破墙壁并很喜欢点燃你的食物储备。因此，保护制冷机的最好方式之一是将其面朝山壁(如果有山的话) ，或将它的热端用墙围起来。在这两种下，都要将屋顶移除。如果基地位于寒冷地带，可以将制冷机的热端导入居住区，辅助卧室升温。通常将冷藏室的墙壁制成双层以增加隔热性。制冷机容易受到太阳耀斑的影响。在冷冻生态区中，仍然需要防止食物因暴露而变质。在这种情况下，将其围起来并增加[[通风孔]]]，使外部冷空气可以进入。

通常在冷藏室的入口处形成气闸（一扇门，一小块空间，然后另一扇通往冷藏室的门），以减少温度交换。由于殖民者和搬运工会经常进出这个房间，因此如果建造[[自动门]]，既可以加快进出速度，又可以最大程度地减少温度变化。

===== 安放位置 =====

由于冷藏室是一种特殊的存储区域，并且依靠的是固定安装的制冷机，因此不容易在基地中移动。这意味着需要仔细计划它的放置位置。

冷藏室需要三个主要通道：
* 一条通道直通户外，或尽可能短地通到户外。动物尸体和农产品通过该通道运输。
* 一条通道连接厨房。冷藏室应建在厨房隔壁。
* 
一条通道通往仓库。这是为了将从屠宰动物中获取的皮革存入仓库、在冷藏室和仓库之间移动缓慢变质的东西，例如玉米，烟叶和根茎等。

此外，随着人口的增加，冷藏室将需要扩展。这意味着应使其一侧不被其他结构所占用，以便将来可以增加其大小而无需破坏其他房间。冷藏室不应太大，因为这将需要更多的制冷机，并且还增加了收集原料及放置成品的步行距离。

实际上，这就要求冷藏室不要建在基地中心。如果这样做，就可以在基地扩张的同时扩建冷藏室。因为要将农产品储存在冷藏室内，所以明智的做法是将其建在种植区附近，并将一个门朝向种植区。这样可以缩短收获后的运输距离。

但是注意，冷藏室并不需要建在基地边缘！一块无屋顶的方块足以排放四个制冷机的废气(在游戏中，如果垂直相连的四个方格是墙或墙类方格，那么该方格算作户外)。只建在山中的基地更应仔细考虑制冷机的排气点。
Be very careful when you dig or build in or around this room.  Leaving even a single gap in a room wall will raise the temperature well above the freezing point, and this is easily missed because there is no direct visual indication of the room temperature.  It can lead to massive amounts of food spoiling if undetected.

It is tempting to dig into a mountain to create a freezing room, but keep in mind that [[infestation]]s can then spawn in this room.  This can actually be a good thing, because eradicating an infestation right inside the freezer room is tactically easy, and it will leave all the filth and dead insects in probably the best location in your base.  Your food supply will, however, be temporarily disrupted in such a scenario.

==== Kitchen ====

[[File:Kitchen area.png|thumb|right|Kitchen area with short walkways for the colonists and separate meal freezer.  Autodoors are used in chokepoints.  The meal freezer and dining room could, and probably would, be more distant in the base.  This layout tries to minimize foot traffic in the kitchen, but it is difficult to avoid.]]

The kitchen is where your colonists cook raw food into [[meals]] to improve colony life. The kitchen should be clean to avoid [[ailments#food poisoning|food poisoning]], which can be attained by the following means:
* Zone out colony animals.
* [[Sterile tile]]s for flooring.
* Place your doors so that your dining room has a shorter path to the freezer than walking through the kitchen

You should build your kitchen right next to your Freezer.

The [[butcher table]] is better placed elsewhere, due to its inherent uncleanliness added with the filth created by butchering. However, it should be placed near the freezer, preferably in a spot in the warehouse right next to it, as both ingredients (dead animals) and products (meats) need to be stored inside the freezer, having the butcher work there greatly reduces travel time. If you plan to make a lot of [[Kibble]], create an extra butcher table outside of the freezer for that task, to avoid the work speed penalty from the cold.

[[Shelf|Shelves]] or small stockpiles can really improve cooking efficiency when placed right next to your stoves. Set one to accept berries and vegetables only, and another to accept meats which would usually be cooked before they spoil. Put those shelves on high priority, so they will be replenished by your haulers and saving time for the cook.  If you take this approach, set up the bills on the stove so that the products (meals) are ''dropped on the floor'' by the cook, and not delivered to a stockpile immediately.  Prepared meals will stack next to the stove and can then be delivered in bulk to the freezer or fridge, close to the dining hall.

It is usually a good idea to add a little art since colonists tend to stay there for a long time. It should be temperature controlled for better working speed.

Since the kitchen is placed near the freezer, some crafting stations which include plants ingredients may be also placed in here. The [[brewery]] and [[drug lab]] are good choices. Also, if you making [[chemfuel]] with food you may place the [[biofuel refinery]] here.

==== Dining room ====

Dining rooms, at their simplest, are simply rooms where you put tables and chairs for colonists to dine in.  Still, tables are marked as Gather Spots by default.  Colonists will hang out here to relax and also hold their parties and weddings here.  Expect your dining room to be pretty crowded during meal times, especially after a party or marriage ceremony, so have enough chairs for at least half your colony.

Colonists, as well as visitors, will search in a 20 tile radius for a table to eat at.  For this reason, a dining room should be built as close as possible to the freezer/food storage so that your colonists will actually use the dining room, instead of eating on the floor of the storage, giving them a -3 mood debuff. This is especially true for larger freezers, in which colonists retrieving food from the far end may simply give up searching for a table and eat on the floor.

Since colonists spend a lot of time here, increase their mood by decorating your dining room with [[sculptures]], [[plant pot]]s or quality furniture. Having an impressive dining room also provides a small mood bonus to colonists who eat there.

==== Rec room ====

You should have a wide variety of [[recreation]] sources so your colonists don't get bored repeatedly throwing horseshoes at a pin, or wandering around aimlessly. Putting all of them in a room also provides a mood bonus after a colonist uses the facilities inside, depending on the impressiveness of the room.

In the early game, all you'll need is a horseshoes pin somewhere in the colony, and colonists will proceed to use it when they are bored.

Once you reach midgame, you can afford more recreation facilities such as chess tables or billiards tables, or [[Tube television]]s, which provide different kinds of recreation for additional variety. In addition, you can also obtain additional recreation sources from exotic goods traders, such as [[telescope]]s or [[Megascreen television|megascreen]] televisions, which offers more recreation than the craftable tube and flatscreen televisions.

Similarly to the dining room, decorating it can improve the mood bonus from using the room.

=== Courtyard ===

[[File:Courtyard.png|400px|thumb|right|Small courtyard that serves both as a dining room and recreation room.]]

Most colonists like getting outside once in a while.  In superstructure bases, you may consider building an unroofed courtyard where colonists can get some fresh air.

You can use it as a common area, putting recreation items and dining tables for colonists to use, making the courtyard behave exactly the same as an unroofed dining/recreation room. Alternatively, it may also be used as a place to put your [[mortar]]s as putting them in the middle helps reduce the impact of their minimum range blind spot. Also consider keeping [[transport pod]]s here, but place them in a separate unroofed area as they are not beautiful to look at.

{{clr}}

=== Laboratory ===

You may want to have a room dedicated to research, with [[hi-tech research bench]]es, [[multi-analyzer]]s to increase research speed and unlock new research.  Room cleanliness affects research speed, so place sterile tiles to keep the room clean. For even better cleanliness, restrict the lab to your researchers and janitors only, reducing traffic and hence the amount of dirt in the room.  Also consider placing some art here and building a comfortable chair, as your researcher will be spending a lot of time here.

=== Workshop ===

Workshops are places where you put all your crafting stations and benches. You should put them near your warehouse so your colonists can spend less time hauling the needed resources to the workshop for crafting, while keeping them separate due to the beauty penalty of raw materials. Also remember to put chairs of any sort at the interaction spot so your colonists won't have to keep standing while crafting.

The [[tool cabinet]] is handy for increasing productivity of your craftsmen. The work speed bonus is quite valuable, and each bench may benefit from two tool cabinets.

It is an excellent idea to '''put decorations such as sculptures inside the workshop''', as a beautiful environment gives up to +15 mood, improving colonists' productivity and even allowing for the occasional mental inspiration.

=== Armory ===

You can choose to have a dedicated area to store your weapons and armor. If so, put it far away from your prison so that prisoners do not have ready access to dangerous weapons during prison breaks.  Place it near your entrance so that colonists can equip themselves on the way to defend your base.

Ammunition, on the other hand, is best stored deeper in the base, preferably far from anywhere else in case of unexpected events such as fires.

=== Hospital ===
[[File:Hospital_example_midgame.png|400px|thumb|right|Hospital with sterile tiles, hospital beds with vital monitors, decorations and megascreen TVs facing the beds.]]

[[File:Compact hospital layout.png|thumb|right|An efficient hospital layout.  Dresser and end tables provide maximum comfort.  Two vitals monitors cover all 8 beds.  Flatscreen TVs provide extra recreation for the patients. Medical supplies are close by, the room is well lit and accessible from all sides. The vents equalize room temperature with the hallway. Up to six more beds could be installed here rather easily: four in place of the end tables, and one each to the left and right of the vitals monitors; all beds will have dresser, TV and monitor coverage.]]

Dedicated hospitals are more of a mid-game thing when you have enough resources to build the specialized equipment used in them. [[Hospital bed]]s provide a boost to treatment quality, immunity gain speed, and healing speed, meaning colonists will recover faster from illnesses and injuries, making them the choice for hospitals. The [[vitals monitor]] brings even better boosts to treatment and immunity gain, so when available it's recommended that you put them down near your hospital beds.

Hospitals should be built somewhere where colonists can quickly bring their downed comrades to treat them. Keep doors open, or use [[autodoor]]s so they don't obstruct colonists' access. If you need to, you can build more elsewhere in the base.

Hospitals should have [[sterile tile]]s as flooring as they provide a slight cleanliness buff that can increase surgery success chance and reduce wound infection chance.  Keep in mind that wounded colonists will bleed out considerably, so you may want to assign another colonist to specifically clean the hospital to improve their treatment chances.

Store your medicine in or near your hospital using [[shelf|shelves]] so your doctors can quickly grab them to patch up colonists before they bleed to death. Sometimes just that little distance can make the difference between life and death.

[[Dresser]] and [[end table]]s ''do increase'' the comfort of the hospital bed.  The furniture does not affect medical treatment, but improves the mood of the colonists while they are recovering.  The downside is that each end table blocks a spot with vitals monitor coverage, but this is not a problem until one needs to squeeze the absolute maximum number of beds into the hospital.

Decorating hospitals to make them beautiful can give colonists inside a great mood boost (max +15, plus impressive room stats). This is good, especially considering that some colonists will stay in the hospital for some time, such as the severely injured, incapacitated or sick.

To provide recreation, you may also install televisions into your hospitals. Patients lying in hospital beds within the viewing area will watch TV to entertain themselves when they are bored, and you won't need colonists coming to cheer them up as their only recreation source.

==== Patient rooms ====

If you have even more resources and space, for example in lategame, you can build a separate room for each colonist. While they don't mind sleeping with others in a hospital, they do get disturbed by them walking around, and dirt can more easily affect cleanliness as well.

==== Operating theater ====

You can build a separate room to accommodate colonists who will undergo surgery, to make sure that colonists undergo medical operations in the cleanest of places.

Your operating theater should be forbidden at all times except when someone is about to have surgery. This prevents colonists from tracking dirt or blood into it, staining it.

==== Vet area ====

Consider building animal sleeping spots with their own animal area near your medicine stockpile that you can restrict wounded animals to.  That way, they can be treated as fast as possible.

Medical treatment for animals benefits from cleanliness as well, but not proper hospital beds (and in turn, vitals monitors). Once you enter midgame, sterile flooring should be easy enough to get.

=== Prison ===

[[File:Prison_example_midgame.png|400px|thumb|right|Mid-late game prison blocks from A17, partially filled. Each cell has a table with a chair, a bed, decorations and a chess table with a chair (for decoration). Generosity like this is well-appreciated and rewarded with prisoners joining your colony. Note that the doors open towards the rest of the base (downwards).]]

==== Prison barracks ====

In the early game you can simply convert any existing ruins into a makeshift prison barracks or build a simple prison hut which holds all the prisoners you capture. Try not to build it too far away from your main structures, otherwise it becomes harder to catch escaping prisoners.  Another option is to mark one of your colonist's bedrooms as a temporary prison while you build another bedroom or a proper prison.

You should include tables and chairs for prisoners to use.  This will improve their mood, which by extension lowers their chances of mental breaks and improves their recruitment speed.

==== Prison cells ====

Like colonists, [[prisoner]]s will also suffer from the mood penalties associated with being kept together in a prison barracks. In addition, prison breaks are more serious should they happen, for every prisoner locked up in the same room will simultaneously break out, while prisoners in different cells may choose not to join. Thus, you should keep them separated.

Each cell should have a table with a chair, a bed, and a light source. This is the bare minimum you need for a prisoner to be decently kept. Decorating the cell and making them bigger also increases mood bonuses for easier recruitment. They can't use any recreation items put in the cell, nor do they have a recreation need, so don't bother with recreational items other than for room impressiveness.

Prisons should have doors facing towards your base, so escaping prisoners will go towards your base instead of away, giving your wardens more time to deal with a break.

==== Holding cell ====

A larger cell with more beds. It should be only be used when your prison cells are overflowing. Put your less important prisoners inside them while assigning your more valuable prisoners into the cells.

=== Multipurpose rooms ===

These are more of an early to early-midgame thing that you can use before you get dedicated structures erected, such as hospitals or bigger prisons. Yet, these can still prove useful sometimes, like when your freezers or warehouses overflow, or you need somewhere to house an influx of injured or sick colonists.

This is rather simple; just make an empty room, along with suitable temperature control. You can add beds if you intend on someone living in it (be it colonists or prisoners), which you can uninstall and tuck away in a corner when unused.

=== Backup ===

There are many types of ways you can set up buildings on your map to possibly save your colonists' lives in dire situations:
*'''Shelters:''' Building small rooms with emergency supplies can save your colonists from enraged animals. Thick enough walls (at least 4 layers) can stop raiders from killing your colonists hiding inside.
*'''[[Nutrient paste dispenser]]s''': When food is running low or you forecast that it will, a paste dispenser can significantly slow down food consumption by efficiently converting raw foods into nutrient paste.
* Strategically placed stockpiles of wood can provide heating, for example during a solar flare or cold snap.  Mark these wood stacks "forbidden", so your colonists will not use them during regular operation.

== Production ==

You will also need various buildings to produce or manufacture the stuff that your colonists need.

=== Crops ===

[[File:SunlampHydroponics.png|thumb|300px|right|Sun lamp illuminating crops grown in hydroponics basins. With this configuration you can fit 24 basins under 1 sun lamp for a total of 96 plants grown.]]

{{See also|Food production}}

==== Crop fields ====

Crop fields are rather simple. Just set up a growing zone, designate the desired plant type and growers will automatically go and grow the plants.

You need to carefully check the soil fertility before marking out your areas. 
*Stony soil looks quite similar to dirt at first glance, but has a greatly reduced fertility, reducing the growing speed of plants.
*Rich soil on the other hand, is visibly darker and has improved fertility, making it suitable for slow growing plants such as [[devilstrand]].

You will need to keep most animals from eating your crops.  You can zone out the area from your tamed animals, but you will need to build walls to keep out wild animals.  If you're not building a greenhouse, then watch out for your builders automatically roofing this "room".

==== Greenhouses ====

Enclosed areas that grow crops with the aid of temperature control, [[sun lamp]]s and possibly [[hydroponics basin]]s. They allow you to continue growing crops regardless of soil or weather conditions.  Note that greenhouses are subject to power draining events like [[Events#Solar Flare|solar flares]], knocking out lamps, heaters and hydroponics. All plants in a basin without power will slowly take damage until they are destroyed. So beware, solar flares or damage to the power grid can destroy whole hydroponics crops.

=== Mining ===

In early-midgame you just need to select mineral outcrops and designate them, and miners will proceed to dig out the minerals.

Once all visible mineral outcrops are mined, you can continue to mine resources in a couple ways. 

==== Strip mining ====

If you have more mountains or rocks which you can mine, you can strip mine them by mining out long tunnels with 2 tiles between each other. This allows you to see all tiles in the mountain. Hopefully, you will hit a mineral deposit.

Covering up your mine to prevent infestations is a good idea, using cheap materials such as [[wood]] it is possible to completely seal up the mines at a low cost. Alternatively, set up defenses at the mine entrance and just farm the insects.

==== Deep drills ====

After research you will unlock the [[deep drill]] and the [[ground-penetrating scanner]] for use.

It is not recommended to start deep drilling without an active scanner as you cannot see the locations of mineral locations.

Some deposits will be directly underneath your base. You can deconstruct or relocate buildings to give access to your drills. Be careful when you mine in colonists' bedrooms as they can easily disturb sleep. Turn off the mineral scanner when you aren't placing new drills, and beware that bugs can be attracted by the drills. Be prepared to deal with infestations near or close to the drill.

=== Animals ===

[[Animals]] are an extremely useful asset to the colony. They provide a variety of products, from raw food materials (meat, eggs or milk), to wool, which is an excellent insulator against both heat and cold. Moreover, they can be used in combat or as pack animals in a [[caravan]]. In fact, some larger and more intelligent animals can be trained as haulers, such as dogs, freeing up colonists for other tasks.

==== Barn ====

Animals are happy to sleep anywhere as long as it's not too hot or cold.  Otherwise, a temperature-controlled barn with animal sleeping spots is necessary to keep the animals comfy.

Building [[animal sleeping box]]es or [[animal bed]]s can help animals rest faster, though this doesn't really do much and is not cost efficient.

==== Chemfuel farming ====

[[Boomalope]]s are unique in the fact that they can produce [[chemfuel]]. This can be used to power generators, used as [[transport pod]] fuel or made into [[mortar shell]]s.

Due to their explosive nature, they won't be attacked by predators, so you can let them roam freely without much danger. Keeping them confined is dangerous as the death of one boomalope can injure others, and if you don't intervene the other boomalopes will die, exploding and causing a chain reaction.

== Power ==

=== Solar power ===

[[File:Solar wind setup.png|thumb|420px|right|Wind turbines with solar generators packed underneath the exclusion zones.]]

[[Solar generator]]s provide power only during the day except during eclipses. It provides a constant 1700W, quite a decent figure, but still shouldn't be fully relied on.

=== Wind power ===

[[Wind turbine]]s provide unstable power day and night. It can provide up to 3450W or nothing at all, and rarely hits its peak production.

It requires plenty of open space for maximum efficiency, and any obstacles in its area reduce efficiency. To prevent trees from growing and obstructing the turbines, put down floors, grow crops underneath the turbines or fill in the gaps with solar generators.

=== Fueled generation ===
{{main|Chemfuel powered generator}}

You can build the [[wood-fired generator]] which runs on wood, or the [[chemfuel powered generator]] which runs on [[chemfuel]], constantly providing 1000W of power. It is a good idea to have some of these as a backup power source, or even as your main source in biomes that are loaded with forests that will replenish themselves, such as in the tropics or temperate forests.

If the biome provides enough wood, the ''wood-fired generator'' is an excellent choice for establishing a colony.  The wood from about two trees will power the generator for three days, giving the colony uninterrupted power to run all important early-game facilities (freezer, lamps and some work tables).

Chemfuel is significantly more efficient than wood, so once you research the [[refinery]] it becomes better to refine wood into chemfuel before usage as fuel.

Both fueled generators will burn fuel at the full rate, even if no power is consumed.  Catching the excess power with batteries, and disabling the generators while the batteries are charged, will make them more fuel-efficient.

==== Boomalope setup ====

Boomalopes generate enough chemfuel to run 1 generator.

3 boomalopes give enough fuel to continuously power 4 generators for a total of 4000W. This is not taking into account any energy costs from growing food for use by the boomalopes.

If the animals have to be fed with grown food for more than a few days during the year, it is more efficient to convert the food straight into chemfuel (in a refinery), instead of feeding it to boomalopes.  On the other hand, if the biome allows the boomalopes to graze for most of the year, this makes them a free source of energy (if you can keep them safe).

==== Greenhouse setup ====

A hydroponic greenhouse will produce far more chemfuel than necessary to power the greenhouse and the required refinery.  This translates into a very high surplus of power (if you build additional generators), or you can use the surplus to grow food or drugs for the colony.  Even a single greenhouse can easily cover the food and energy needs of a mid-sized colony, without having to rely on any other power source.

==== Infinite chemreactor setup ====

[[Infinite chemreactor]]s generate enough chemfuel to run a generator, which in turn generates more than enough power to run the chemreactor.

3 infinite chemreactors can generate enough fuel to power 5 generators, for a total surplus power of 4100W.

Because the ''infinite chemreactor'' is a rare quest reward, it is unlikely that you will be able to create a setup that produces enough power for the entire colony.

=== Geothermal power ===

[[Geothermal generator]]s constantly give 3600W of power after being built on a steam geyser, without requiring fuel. It is an important source of power from mid-game onward, as it is constant and high-powered. A basic mid-sized colony can be sustained using 5 generators, around the usual number of geysers found on the map. 

Research is required to unlock it. The generator itself is quite costly so it's best left to midgame. It is possible to rush the research for geothermal power, though you should be careful not to neglect other more important research projects. However, once researched and built you can have a constant power supply.

Make sure your geothermal generators and their connecting conduits are well-protected as they often have to be placed far from base. Walling the generators helps protect them against raiders, but walling the conduits isn't recommended due to the cost and its hindrance on colonist field work. 

Be aware of the heat that the geysers release. If you closely wall and roof in a geothermal generator, the temperature inside will be quite high, enough to set combustibles on fire (including the generator itself). It is thus necessary to remove the roofs on such buildings. However, if the vent is close to your base in a cold biome, consider attaching it to your own base to help heat it.

=== Power storage ===

[[Battery|Batteries]] store electricity during times of excess and release it during times when demand exceeds supply. You will need batteries to store power if you're using unstable power supplies such as wind or solar power. Batteries must be kept under a roof to prevent short circuits. They should also be protected from external threats as losing batteries to raiders or mortars can cripple your power supply.

=== Emergency power ===
 
Some events will cause you to lose power if you are unprepared. Some colonies rely on wind or solar power to power everything.  Eventually, every colony with electricity will suffer from a [[Events#Zzztt...|conduit explosion]]. Since you will be relying on batteries to store your power, this can cause a lot of disruption if the renewable energy isn't enough to power your base while your now empty batteries recharge. Raiders attacking and destroying power conduits connected to power generators can sever power from the colony, reducing the power available.  In all these circumstances, this can leave you without enough power for your freezers, production, hydroponics, temperature control or even your turrets.  However, it can be mitigated:
*'''Backup batteries''': Always have spare power stores, such as separate battery systems with switches. Once charged, flick the switch to isolate them from the rest of the power grid. Only reconnect it when your main grid has run out or the reserves need charging.
*'''Backup generators''': Have some fueled generators that you bring online only if there's not enough power in the colony. This can allow your backup batteries to discharge slower or even recharge. If they are turned off they will not consume fuel.

=== Vanometric power cell ===

A [[vanometric power cell]] constantly provides 1000 W of power, out of thin air.  It handles like a battery, and can be reinstalled at will.  It is the best portable power source in the game, very useful on mining caravans, and if you want to take your entire colony on the long trip to the event spaceship.

Unfortunately, the Vanometric Power Cell is a rare quest reward, and there is no guarantee to obtain one during the course of a game.

If the additional 1000 W from the VPC is not needed in your colony, it can be used as a risk-free way to keep any number of batteries at full charge, indefinitely.  Place the battery array directly adjacent to the VPC; this will keep it charged without the possibility of short-circuiting, since no power conduits are used.  Do not connect this installation to the rest of your power grid.

=== Power network ===

It's not a good idea to have just 1 conduit spanning the entirety of your base.  While it saves materials, short circuits or other events can cripple your power supply to parts of your base.  Instead, build a network with redundant pathways so that the grid will continue to function even if there is a break somewhere in the network.  Consider using doors to cover up the beauty penalty for exposed conduit indoors.

Since geothermal generators must be built on top of existing geysers, they are often located far from your base. It is best to connect geothermal generators to other geothermal generators so that events such as wildfires and raider attacks won't easily disconnect them from your power network, causing severe power shortages.

== Defenses ==
{{main|Defense structures}}
{{see also|Defense tactics}}

Unless you're playing on Peaceful difficulty, you will eventually encounter major threats, so you will need to prepare defenses for that.

Preparation is a huge advantage that you have. You can fortify your defenses to make the most out of your defending colonists, and tilt the field towards your favor.

*Cover is a major aspect in defense. While enemies are hiding behind rock chunks, you have [[sandbags]] and walls on your side, giving you a significant upper hand. You can even clear the rock chunks to force enemies behind trees which are less optimal a cover choice, widening the advantage.
*You get to choose where the enemy attacks (unless they use sappers to tunnel in). It is a good idea to only have one or two entrances with lots of defenses and traps to repel attacks. 
*You can choose to build [[turret]]s if you have unlocked them. They are essential if you don't have enough colonists to defend against raids, either the start of the Rich Explorer scenario or lategame when you have a lot of wealth that will attract an army of raiders.

== Temperature control ==

Room should have its temperature regulated by some method or another, so as to keep a comfortable temperature for colonists to live in, and protect them from extreme temperature conditions such as heat waves, cold snaps or simply the ambient temperature outdoors.

Large rooms such as your dining room or rec room should have their own [[heater]]s and [[cooler]]s. If they are interconnected you may want to open doors for faster colonist access and temperature exchange. If you choose to do so, remember to close doors if a fire breaks out in the room.

Colonists will complain if sleeping in the extreme heat or cold. Bedrooms and other smaller rooms should be thermally connected to a larger central space via [[vent]]s. Your heaters and coolers should be all placed outside the bedrooms. This reduces the number of heaters and coolers you need to build while keeping your bedrooms at a comfy temperature at the same time.

Keep in mind that you will also need to be prepared in case of a freak temperature event such as heat waves or cold snaps. Without enough temperature devices rooms can get uncomfortably cold or hot, and in severe cases begin to cause hypothermia or heatstroke.

=== Cooler gap prevention ===

As coolers need to be built as part of a wall, the process of building a cooler involves tearing down the original wall, then putting the cooler in place. This short interval allows temperature to go freely through the gap, which isn't something you want.

To fix this, you can plug the gap by building a cheap wooden wall in front of or behind the cooler blueprint, then starting work on the cooler. The wooden wall will prevent temperatures from equalizing easily. Remember to deconstruct the wall after the cooler is done.

=== Protected coolers ===

Coolers are very fragile and must be placed in a wall, so a single explosion or dedicated effort from melee attackers can easily break them down. Protecting the coolers helps fortify your base against enemy raids by eliminating the weak points in your walls.  This is done by walling the coolers off while giving it unroofed space in front of the hot end to vent away heat.

If your colony is in a cold but not quite freezing biome, consider venting the heat from the coolers for your freezer into your living spaces instead.

==== Cooler column ====

Place several coolers in line with the hot end facing an unroofed area where the heat vents out into the open. That unroofed area can be placed within an existing structure, such as inside the freezer. For maximum spatial efficiency, the strips of unroofed area should be 1 tile wide, surrounded by coolers.  This method is best used for freezers to keep cool as most cases don't call for many coolers.

=== Temporary temperature control ===

If your regular heaters or coolers aren't doing the trick, there's a temporary power outage, or you're a tribe without the ability to harness electricity yet, you can use [[campfire]]s or [[passive cooler]]s to heat or cool down your base respectively. Campfires can't heat above 30буC while passive coolers can't cool below 15буC.  Also, their temperature effect is full and cannot be throttled. Depending on what gear your colonists are wearing, it's possible for them to be in a room being heated with campfires and complain about it being too hot.

These are best used to keep colonists comfortable during heat waves or cold snaps. If you always encounter uncomfortable temperatures during summer or winter, then it's time to upgrade your heaters or cooler system.

== Miscellaneous ==

=== Dirt floors ===

Until you have enough manpower to spare for cleaning jobs, use the terrain directly instead of building any floors. Dirt trailed on constructed floors makes for a much worse beauty and cleanliness penalty than using dirt floors, so this can actually make your rooms look better and be 'cleaner'.

For places like hospitals however, it's better to use sterile tiles and manually clean them instead.

=== Flooring outside ===

To reduce the amount of dirt inside your colony buildings, put any kind of flooring covering places where colonists and animals frequently walk. This reduces the amount of dirt formed as well as causes dirt to be left outside where it does not look as bad. 

This should obviously be done only if you have enough janitors, otherwise it's better to just not build any floors (see above).

=== Bridges ===

[[Bridge]]s allow for fast movement and some building on shallow sections of rivers and marshy terrain types.  They're great for allowing colonies to span rivers, as well as making building in swampy biomes a bit easier.  Note that some objects cannot be built or placed on bridges.

=== Moisture pumps ===

[[Moisture pump]]s clear out moisture from the ground around them, making solid land that is suitable for construction and in most cases, agriculture.  They are excellent in swamp biomes for clearing out shallow water, marshy soil and mud in order to build structures.  Their effect is permanent, so they can safely be deconstructed once the land you want to use is dry.
